## 📚 Assignments Included

| File Name                                        | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Assignment 2.1.docx / .pdf`                     | Covers tree traversal strategies including breadth-first search, depth-first search, and limited DFS. Includes multiple problem formulations such as map coloring, fault identification, and maze navigation. |
| `Assignment 3.1.pdf`                             | Describes a Bayesian network design for a nuclear power plant alarm system including Boolean and sensor nodes with justification. |
| `Bayesian_Network_Alarm_System.docx`            | Detailed written explanation and node justification for the Bayesian network described in Assignment 3.1. |
| `What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work.*` | Analytical reading assignment covering large language models (LLMs), token prediction, and the mechanics of ChatGPT based on Stephen Wolfram's explanation. |
| `WHR2018Data.xlsx`                               | Dataset likely used for an AI-related exercise such as predictive modeling, clustering, or decision support systems. |
